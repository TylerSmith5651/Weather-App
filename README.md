# Weather App ReadMe

This app was created as part of a Visual Studios II course I took in 2018, and has lived on my desktop since. 
Essentially this app makes an API call to a weather service server and displays the Weather, Temperature, and 
an Icon on the app as a result. You simply enter the Zip Code you want to check, press Get Weather, and the 
display will change based on call results.
